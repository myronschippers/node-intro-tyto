# Node Introduction

### What is Node?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment (i.e. a running program) built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
engine (i.e. a program or library that executes JavaScript code).

### How we will use Node

We will use Node to handle HTTP requests. We'll accept requests, do some logic, and return an HTTP response to our client (e.g. the browser).


### What's NOT in Node?

We do not have a DOM in Node. This means that jQuery will not work in our server side code. We will still continue to use jQuery in code that we run on the client.
